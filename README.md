# Gerty RISK Map

Map rendering/game engine-esque thing for playing RISK, the board game.

Very WIP.

## Getting Started

`npm install`

Probably best to look at the storybook first:

`npm run storybook`

This will show you the individual components in use. Have a browse under "MAPS > World Map" to see the familiar RISK "board" in different states.

To play around with the game itself:

`npm run start:dev`
